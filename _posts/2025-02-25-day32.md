title: "Day 32 - Event-driven integration - Service Bus"
date: 2025-02-25
---

- Spent another half working day on trying to use Event Hubs as autoscaler
- Meeting with Tom (my Strouwi internship guide) to discuss way forward
  - Remembered that I was supposed to use Service Bus instead of Event Hubs
  - I still had a tab open with Event Grid (original plan) which uses
  Event Hubs underneath it
    - I went on the wrong path due to my own mistake, course corrected
- Created infrastructure Service Bus for event-driven triggering
- After a lot of troubleshooting I was able to get my jobs to run
- Refactored my code from Event Hubs to Service bus
  - Messages are simpler, Event Hubs has a CloudMessage with a property Data
  which contains the actual data
  - Service Bus seems to have this in the body
  - Tried many ways of retrieving this, retrieved all env variables but to no avail
    - Will have to retrieve this from the queue again, sadly
