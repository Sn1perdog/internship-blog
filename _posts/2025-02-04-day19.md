- Work on and finish the end-to-end implementation
  - Calling from frontend now uses user's organizationId and performs calls to microservice
  - Ran into maven and pipeline issues, which colleague assisted with
  - Opened PR's for all of them
- Assist colleagues with Playwright
  - They previously had interns create E2E testing
  - It is completely broken now, they were going to revive it
  - I have experience with Playwright
  - Analyzed the setup, they were doing full browser redirects instead of navigation
  - Every single test logged in
    - Implemented single login `setup.ts`, which saves localStorage to a file
    which each test can start from
  - Assisted in best practices like what kind of elements to select on,
  increase stability of tests by selecting on the parent container before checking
  - Noticed a lot of timeouts, while they could just wait
