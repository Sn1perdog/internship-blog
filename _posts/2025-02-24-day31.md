title: "Day 31 - Event-driven integration - Troubles with Event Hubs"
date: 2025-02-24
---

- Started on full infrastructure Event Hubs for event-driven triggering
  - This has Checkpoints which require a storage account
  - Configuration of secrets in "Scale rules" is different than the rest of Azure,
  this is through KEDA, but Azure is providing a custom frontend for it
    - The only way you could know this is by log analysis
  - `secretref` is required
  - Autoscaler cannot access the checkpoints
    - Error `unable to get checkpoint from storage: %!w(<nil>)`
    - Spent a lot of time trying different permutations of the checkpoint config,
    different storage & blob setups
    - Dove into the source code of the KEDA event hub autoscaler
      - Checkpoints is ALWAYS required, so no way around it
      - Provides locking mechanism for concurrent executions
