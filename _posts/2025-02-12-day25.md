title: "Day 25 - Event based job triggers"
date: 2025-02-12
---

- Given assignment to investigate the job based triggering of Timefold solving
- Created ADR investigating Storage Queue vs. Event Grid vs. Service Bus
- Decided on events as this provides
  - data capacity (queue & service bus max 256Kb, event grid 1Mb)
  - cheap triggering (service bus expensive)
  - easy setup and management
  - Fan out triggering
  - Near real-time triggering
- Start implementation of Event Grid based triggering, after consulting with Tom
  - There are conflicting resources from Azure, outdated links and functionality
   which doesn't work as before
  - Create queue's, publishers and subscribers
  - Try to create job but facing ACR (Azure Container Registry) permission issues
    - Can't access uploaded image
