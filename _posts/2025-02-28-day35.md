We need to integrate the automated planning with the rest of the Planning tool.
There already exists a calendar for the Planning purposes, integrate the tools.

- Implemented a new "AI-toewijzing" button in frontend, in the "Open tasks"
  - This sends currently displayed unscheduled PlannedTask id's, which are retrieved, mapped
- Implemented endpoint which receives this request
- Refactored and unified into the existing PlannedTask domain and infra
- Added persistence of job for full front-to-back status tracking
- Updated job
  - model updates,
  - persistence to created record by backend
- A lot of small changes were required in a lot of places, troubleshooting
