title: "Day 37 - new constraints, improve planning"
date: 2025-03-04

- Processed PR feedback, refactored, use more beans based on environment
- Fixed pipelines, renaming the repository to `ai-planning-job` caused many issues
- Recorded demo of event-driven AI planning
- Started on keeping recurrence of tasks in mind, currently it plans jobs sequentially and
doesn't care about if it plans the same job twice in a row
  - Create new constraints
    - Task must respect its scheduleFrom/scheduleTo
    - Task must be scheduled within allowed timeslot (if specified)
    - Task must be during employee work hours
- Started on optimizing the problem space
  - The solver, with a lot of timeslots has a massive problem space because this is a NP-problem (quadratic)
    - This reaches 4x10^12 possible permutations on relatively straightforward problems
  - Limiting the amount of possible timeslots
