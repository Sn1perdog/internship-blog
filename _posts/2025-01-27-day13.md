- Continued Herculean task of mapping all of the domains and models within BuildBase,
according to [proposed DTO's](https://github.com/Strouwi-BV/strouwi_documentation/blob/main/Technical/Projects/ResourceCapacityPlanning/4_dtos.md)
- Considered either a fully custom mapper or @MapStruct, but entire project uses
MapStruct
- I want a simple interface which handles all logic internally, hiding complexity
  - Add internal validations on objects
  - Map Clients and Projects to Tasks
  - Map Users to Teams, and define on tasks elligible users and teams
