- Leadership and team want more explanation about hexagonal architecture
  - They feel the need for change, but want a broader explanation
- Prepare a guide on Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal) architecture
  - Resources in use:
    - Book: "Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture" by Tom Hombergs
      - Best book on the subject, taught me a lot in the past
    - Blog: Alistair Cockburn's [original blog post](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/)
