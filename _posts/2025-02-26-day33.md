- Performed more testing on retrieving the body, but to no success
- Created an out adapter (in line with hexagonal arch.) to receive messages from Service Bus
  - Retrieves the latest one, converts the body's BinaryData to String, to class representation
  - Thanks to the large amount of troubleshooting, the logs and error handling are in place
- Deployed Docker container, small fixes, runs planning successfully
- Refactored running locally and tests to use mock data and end without exit code
  - This prevented tests from completing successfully
