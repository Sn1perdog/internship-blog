title: "Day 18 - End to end implementation with real data"
date: 2025-02-03

- Work on full end-to-end implementation with real data
  - Faced mapper issues
  - Refactored many classes
  - Refactored mapper
- Simplified hexagonal architecture in Planning Service
  - Make it easier for team members to get into it
- Discussed Azure high level architecture further
  - Might need a refactor, all Optaplanner work will have to go into its own Service
  - This will potentially run on `Azure Container Apps Jobs`
  - Current `planning_service` will be responsible for `Task` management as well
    - Will be ported from monolith, might not be in scope of internship
