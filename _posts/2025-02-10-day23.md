- Finish and refine presentation hexagonal architecture
- Further discussion on the splitting of our application into microservices,
recommended waiting until my presentation next day to make a decision
- Created ADR for keeping `Tasks` in the domain, not just splitting it off
because our monolith is getting out of hand
