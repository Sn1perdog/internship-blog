title: "Day 27 - Event based job triggers"
date: 2025-02-14

- Continue implementation of Event based triggering
- Azure Container App Jobs have __Many__ trigger points, apparently Event Grid
isn't one of them...
- Investigated and decided to switch to Azure Service Bus, which is still
cost effective and provides a larger feature set
  - Refined related ADR
- Resolved ACR permission issues, was able to use the admin Access Key through
CLI to upload image
- Investigated triggering job with dummy data locally, important for testing
