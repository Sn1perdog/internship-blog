- Continue implementation of Event based triggering
- Resolved ACR permission issues, was able to use the admin Access Key through
CLI to upload image
- Investigated triggering job with dummy data locally, important for testing
- Azure Container App Jobs have __Many__ trigger points, apparently Event Grid
isn't one of them...
  - KEDA (Kubernetes Autoscaler) doesn't have an implementation of Event Grid
- Investigated which other event pub/sub sytem we can use
