title: "Day 34 - Implement new PlannedTask model" 
date: 2025-02-27

As noted earlier, there was a new model called "PlannedTask", which is an individual Task
instance which can be allocated to a time slot in the rosters/calendars.
My code has to be refactored to make use of this new model.

- Main orchestrating backend
  - Refactored controller to receive PlannedTaskIDs which need to be planned
  - Updated DTOs
  - Updated the mapper
    - Removed clients and projects as this was decided to be out of scope for now
  - Implemented repositories and validated sending
- Planning Job
  - Updated DTOs & model
  - Updated mappers
  - Refactored classes to simplify date/time handling
  - Refactor Timefold (Optaplanner) solution solver to make use of new model
- Added new fields to the PlannedTask model, for analysis of AI generated tasks
