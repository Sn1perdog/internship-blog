- Continue on task recurrence
  - Created new constraints
    - Employee cannot have overlapping tasks
    - minimize employee idle time
- Made the Constraints as simple as possible, put the comparison logic in
helper functions
- Created tests, including edge-cases like planning over midnight, finishing
and starting on the same hour for task, null values on duration,...
- Add proper job failure saving
  - Add a failure screen in frontend
