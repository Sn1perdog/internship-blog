- Finish mapper, refactored
  - Write unit tests

- Discussions with tech lead on Vue3
  - Vue2 only allowed for the Options API
  - Vue3 recommends the Composition API, but they would prefer to keep it
  - Write ADR to discuss this,
- Issues with my local MongoDB instance
  - Backend can't query a mongodb instance with `retryable` without replication
    - Configuration changes to allow for replication
    - Initialization of a replication environment
    - Ensure master/slave configuration, otherwise it doesn't work
  - My BuildBase organization doesn't have required rights
    - Required not only the `Subscription` collection to have the correct data, but
    also `Organization.ActiveSubscription`
- Update onboarding documents
