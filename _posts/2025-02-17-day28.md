- Travel to Belgium
- Further investigation into event pub/sub revealed Azure Service Bus to me,
which is still cost effective and provides a larger feature set
  - Refined related ADR
- Process PR feedback
- Had a productive refinement session
  - Coworkers proposed Hexagonal tickets
- Retrospective
  - Discussions on point allocation, what a point is
