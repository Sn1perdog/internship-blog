- Processed PR comments
- Troubleshoot and optimize job failures
  - Created a custom exception for display to enduser
  - Had trouble getting my constraint out of the stack
- Continued on performance optimizations
  - Continue with reducing timeslots by removing irrelevant timeslots
    - Timeslots without tasks
    - Timeslots without employee availability
  - Reduced problem space from 4x10^12 to 4 billion for 5 employees and 10 tasks
  - TimeSlots were the biggest impactor of the quadratic equation
  - This trades upfront calculation time for solving time
- Discovered many more failure modes
  - no workschedule (employee works X hours on Y days)
  - no time slots per day (Employee works from X to Y on Z)
    - Enrichment by AI-job, assuming standard business hours
  - no task end because it's a 1-time task
  - usage of inactive users
  - many more fixes
- More AI-planning optimizations
- Mongock migrations were in the wrong package (starting from be.strouwi. ...
Instead of com.strouwi, like the rest of the code)
  - Researched Mongock and decided it is safe to change the package because all
  scripts have a unique ID, otherwise it would purely be based on package
- Many more fixes of things that bugged me in the main application
