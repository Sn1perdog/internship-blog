- Had initial meeting with mentor to discuss project scope and expectations.
- Started researching Timefold solver capabilities and documentation.
- Created project repository and set up development environment.
- **Learning Point**: Discovered Timefold is a fork of OptaPlanner, needed to
adjust research focus.
- Asked clarifying questions about the current system architecture, which
changed since I last saw it 2 years ago.
